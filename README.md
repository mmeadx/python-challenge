# Using Python

From the _University of Minnesota Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp_, I used the PyBank and PyPoll dataset and created a .py file to read the data and print an analysis as a .txt file. 

# PyPoll

The goal for this dataset was to figure out the winner of a hypothetical election. Not only did we want to learn who won, we wanted to be able to use this code to determine the winner of any election. The code in the main.py file does just that.

# PyBank

The goal for this dataset was to determine the Total, Average Change, and Greatest Increase and Decrease in profits between two months.
